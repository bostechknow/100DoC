# 100 Days of Code Journal

- Day 21: 02/24/22 - Managed to study some non-coding related stuff today.  Work was productive.  I decided to make a simple script for testing curl functionality in python.  I used a couple different formats to test the results.  It is nothing significant.  However, I think I can use this as a baseline for making a more useful URL testing script.  It will be useful for eventually making a web scrapper tool for other things.  Definitely has some things that can be improved upon in this tool.  Also, tried avoiding pip install packages to get this to work.  Maybe a future version in the Python dev container.

- Day 11: 02/11/22 - I still haven't gone back to the Udemy 100 Days of Code course yet.  I did check what the day two challenge was a tip calculator.  I didn't check the solution, and haven't gone through the lessons parts yet.  I did make today's script based on that challenge.  I was able to re-use my while loop, to be able to perform multiple calculations.  I did have to look up the round method for floats.  Mostly happy with the result.  I do want to go back and convert the calculations into a function eventually.  Likewise, I want to give the option for a custom tip percentage.  Probably easier to resolve in that function idea.

- Day 12: 02/12/22 - I made a simple calculator for today's script.  It does simple operations and only with integers currently.  I need to go back eventually and allow for integers or floats.  An advanced version could allow for parathensis or multiple numbers.  I should colorize the results as well in the future - symbols one or two colors, and result in a different color from the original numbers.  Watched a video about python decorators, and lambdas.  Definitely something that I need some more experience before really being able to effectively use them, rather than simple mimic.

- Day 13: 02/13/22 - I didn't get a lot of studying done today.  Tomorrow should be better.  I did get a profile created on hackerrank and codewars.  I tried the first couple on hackerrank.  Watched a few other minor videos.  I decided today besides the videos and other tinkering on sites, to take the beer file, and npc generator and combine them.  I had to take the lists and random generators out of a function to get it to work for me right now.  I need to figure out how to make that a function again, and return the various outputs to make the code a little cleaner.  I need to add more values to the npc generator to be useful.

- Day 14: 02/14/22 - I watched a few more videos on FreeCodeCamp for the python program, mostly about loops and logic.  I also completed 4 or 5 more challenges at hackerrank today.  Only a little bit of other studying completed today.  I did create two scripts, they perform basically the same thing.  Generate random numbers, keep a running addition total, and print a final total.  One allows the personal choice of total numbers to generate.  The other randomly determines how many to generate, and tally.  The second script, I tinkered with the bcolor class again.  I like then functionality.  I will need to play with it more in the future.

- Day 15: 02/15/22 - I watched a few more videos on FreeCodeCamp's python program.  Still lots of focus on loops and logic.  I tried working on hackerrank, but it was horribly slow, so no real progress.  Only created one script today.  I used the colorized text a couple times, for practice.  The one script needs some polish, but it gets the job done.  It deals with list and list methods.  I should eventually turn the output from a bunch of things, to a loop and let the user decide what outputs they want to see.

- Day 16: 02/18/22 - I haven't done anything the past couple days, due to feeling exhausted and unable to concentrate.  Today, I decided to take a break from Python, and study some very basics about Go(lang).  I copied my Go dev container into Day16 folder, for a standardized copy being available.  I do need to create a location for various devcontainers, for quicker pull and usage.  I do like some aspects of Go(lang).  Eventually, need to do the same thing as today, but for several other languages - Rust, Nodejs, and PHP.  Maybe, I will try one of them tomorrow.

- Day 17: 02/19/22 - I didn't get a lot of studying done today.  But, I did decide to go through the first part of a Rustlang crash course.  I think it was fun and different.  It's interesting to see some of the differences and similarities between them.  I didn't finish the video, but I think it was a good start.  I will get back to it later in this coming week most likely.  Also created the location for the devcontainers.  So some repo clean-up today.

- Day 18: 02/20/22 - I didn't get a lot of studying done today.  I decided today would be a good day to tinker with another language again.  Today's topic was Node.js.  It was interesting watching through the couple videos and playing with the devcontainer.  Not sure I am much of a fan of Node.js right now, but I assume it will grow on me, like mold?!?!?  I will need to play a little more to get a better feeling for it.  So far, Go is my favorite of the three excurions, then Rust, then Node.js.

- Day 19: 02/21/22 - I got a little bit of studying done today.  Nothing major, but some is better than none.  Today, I decided to create a tarot card generator.  I think it turned out okay.  I have some improvements that could be useful to do later.  It was nice working on Python again today.  In general, kind of an average day, but good after last weeks couple days that I missed.

- Day 20: 02/23/22 - I got some studying done today.  It's been fairly productive.  I wasn't able to study/code yesterday, I could not make myself do it.  Feeling back on track today.  I made a simple clue guessing game today.  I feel good about the random function, better with the while loops, and I will eventually remember the full syntax for the colorized text class.  Tomorrow, I will definitely get some more studying done.  Looking forward to tinkering with Go again this week.

### Note: My Best score for the Clue Guessing game(Day20 script):

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- Day 1: 01/31/22 - Started a little of the Udemy 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2022.  I will setup repl.it and the code rooms for testing at a later time.  I did the final task which is script day01a.py.  It gets the job done.  Nothing fancy, but that is okay.  I created day01.py by coming up with some random tasks, and then created a if, elif, else check.  I think that turned out pretty decent.  I need to add some features later, but I think this was a good start for today, and for this 100 days of coding.

- Day 2: 02/01/22 - Cleaned up my readme.  Added a bunch of links that I've found recently.  I will try and work with them a little more in the near future.  For now, at least, I have a clean location, rather than 20 tabs open in my browser.  I created a new script today, day02.py.  This was a random idea that I came up with.  It didn't take too long to get it working properly.  The while loop was the hard part, that took some more time to get it to work properly.  I think this was a good second day.

- Day 3: 02/02/22 - Decided to create a new script that uses a python defined function to perform some simple math.  I used the while loop format from yesterday to have some extra practice with it.  I had to recheck the math operators, accidently used exponent instead of multiply at first.  Created a second script to print out UTF-8 characters.  My first attempt simply ran from 0 until the number provided with a space seperator.  The second solution allowed for a starting and ending value of the range of desired characters.  Also, I went through three more of the "courses" from freeCodeCamp's Scientific Computing with Python.  It's a few of the starting lessons from Python for Everybody.  Mostly a refresher, but it's nice to listen to something while working on the scripts.

- Day 4: 02/03/22 - Cleaned up the exponents in day03.py.  Created a new script today to be a random card generator.  First solution was a simple check if check and generate a card.  The second solution gives option for how many cards to generate.  Eventually need to go back and potentially prevent duplicate answers.  That is going to be more complex in figuring out.  I did watch a couple more of the "courses" on freeCodeCamp this morning.  Added my links to the readme.

- Day 5: 02/04/22 - Went through a couple more lessons on freeCodeCamp today.  Didn't really go through much on my Udemy course.  Didn't really work with repl.it either.  I will try and spend some more time on those tomorrow.  Going to spend a couple extra hours tomorrow studying.  Decided to create a new script working with random, lists, and a loop again.  I made a simple random npc generator.  Fortunately, didn't have to do much in the way of debugging, which is kind of nice.  Mostly tinkered with cleaning up the presentation.  I need to come up with a broader range of values, but I did confirm that both ends of the list were able to be generated in the script.  Eventually, I need to figure out how to import the values from a json document, to be able to swap out lists and still use the same generator body.  Should be helpful for future rpg projects.

- Day 6: 02/05/22 - I didn't get to study much today after all.  Errands ended up eating away a lot of my time.  I did decide to continue on the same path as the past couple days.  Practiced with custom functions, if condition, and random number generators.  This is a good start for a more robust rpc dice roller.  I will need to eventually see about combining scripts together to do the work.  Also, I need to figure out a better way to print out the results, so they are not all on a different line.  Added some rpg generator links to the README.md.  Should be good for future research.

- Day 7: 02/06/22 - I didn't get to study much today again.  Sigh.  I need to try again tomorrow.  I decided to try the first attempt at the beer journal.  Spent a lot of time trying to troubleshooting the writing multiple lines to file.  Managed to finally get it done with a list.  Formatting took a bit of time to try and get it mostly the way I want to see the file format.  In general, I feel this is a good start to my journal I want to create.  I like the fact that the script will create the notes file, if it doesn't exist.

- Day 8: 02/07/22 - I didn't get to study today again.  I had a raging headache.  I tried taking my day 5 npc generator and convert it for Shadow of the Demon Lord random npc generator.  It works for the most part.  I am having major issues getting the profession to choose a proper subclass.  Not sure if I need to break them into individual functions, or create a dictionary with them.  Generally just frustrated, and calling it quits for tonight.  I will try and research more tomorrow, and see if I can correct it.

- Day 9: 02/08/22 - Not a lot of studying again today.  Work kept me busier than expected.  I did tinker a little with the day 8 script, but still haven't worked it out.  I will let it sit for a bit, and try again maybe next week.  I created a new script today.  It's a simple rock, paper, scissors game.  It asks if you want to play at the start, and expects appropriate input.  Tests all appear to give correct evaluation of choices made.  Finally, it allows the continuation of playing.  Future improvements need to be a win/loss ration count at the end, also need to consider converting to rock, paper, scissors, lizard, spock for more variety.  I need to look up all the permutations of wins/losses with the extra options.

- Day 10: 02/10/22 - Didn't get to do anything yesterday due to feeling ill.  Today, I decided to make a simple quest generator.  I tried to replace a word in one result with a different random variable.  I wasn't successful with that path.  But, I was able to concatanate two random generated results into one variable.  Once that was successful, I did some quick searching to find a class to colorize text output.  Added notes for other colors, for future usage.  Also, made a simple grammar correction in a previous script.
