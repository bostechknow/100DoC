# 100 Days of Code Journal

- Day 1: 01/31/22 - Started a little of the Udemy 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2022.  I will setup repl.it and the code rooms for testing at a later time.  I did the final task which is script day01a.py.  It gets the job done.  Nothing fancy, but that is okay.  I created day01.py by coming up with some random tasks, and then created a if, elif, else check.  I think that turned out pretty decent.  I need to add some features later, but I think this was a good start for today, and for this 100 days of coding.

- Day 2: 02/01/22 - Cleaned up my readme.  Added a bunch of links that I've found recently.  I will try and work with them a little more in the near future.  For now, at least, I have a clean location, rather than 20 tabs open in my browser.  I created a new script today, day02.py.  This was a random idea that I came up with.  It didn't take too long to get it working properly.  The while loop was the hard part, that took some more time to get it to work properly.  I think this was a good second day.
