# Home to my notes & scripts from trying 100 Days of Code

I started the 100 Days of Code today, 01/31/22.  I have not forked the community repo yet.  Not entirely sure that I will, but I will at least include a link for it.  I have not downloaded, and signed the coding promise.  I will do that in the next couple days.  This is going to contain some useful links.  Right now, it's kind of a scratch pad of junk.

My goal for the 100 Days of Code is to become comfortable with Python and complete the Udemy course.  I also want to try and tackle a couple of the projects that are in the "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python".  I also have an idea for a simple beer journal that I want to create.  It will take input and store the information initially in a text file.  Eventually, I want to have the journal to be searchable, and potentially store the data in a sqlite/mongodb database instead of a flat text file.  Maybe a csv file instead.  Will have to see what works out easiest, and appropriately.

I will likely dabble here and there during the 100 Days of Code with some other languages - go, rust, php, or nodejs.  Not really trying to become proficient in any of them.  Mostly a matter of gaining a little familiarity with them, due to their popularity.
